WP2SMFBridge
====

WP2SMFBridge is a simple one way bridge from Wordpress to Simple Machine Forum (v2 tested). This means, this one uses databases of SMF Forum and sync to WP database every time a user performs login or logout action in WP. To get this working only use WP to register/login/logout. Also, WP and SMF must be installed in same domain, and should not be being accessed through a subdomain, though it still work. For example, if your website contains of Wordpress for news and SMF for forum, if your news is mydomain.com, then your forums should be somewhere like mydomain.com/forum.

This plugin will do these following tasks:

* If a user log in WP, then that user will be logged in SMF.
* If a user logout in WP, then that user will be logout in SMF.
* If a user created/register/change password in WP, those actions happen on SMF! 
* Users that are created in SMF can be used once disabled WP plugin.
* V2 work with old WP users!
* For a full way integration use with SMF2WPBridge plugin.

Installation
====

You must have SMF installed as a directory within your domain. Your forum and WordPress installations should not be on different domains or subdomains! Your blog on mydomain.com and forum on forum.mydomain.com will not work!

For example, if you access your blog from mydomain.com, your wordpress installation is at mydomain.com/wordpress, then it is possible that you can access your forum at mydomain.com/forum. 

1. Upload `WP2SMFBridge` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Uncheck "Enable local storage of cookies" and "Use subdomain independent cookie" in SMF. You can turn it off from Admin -> Configuration -> Server Settings -> Cookies and Sessions
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Edit plugin with edit link. Enter path to your forum, then Save it. If it is accessible, then at this point, WP2SMFBridge is fully activated.
